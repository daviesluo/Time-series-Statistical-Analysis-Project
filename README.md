# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Project (MAS8382)

A comprehensive time series analysis project implementing and comparing three different forecasting approaches: Seasonal ARIMA, Time-Series Regression, and Dynamic Linear Models (DLM). The project analyses 10 years of monthly sales data (2011-2020) to predict future sales trends.

## Project Overview
- Applied statistical analysis of time series data using R
- Implementation of multiple forecasting methodologies
- Comparative analysis of model performance
- Theoretical exploration of ARIMA models and seasonal effects

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Model implementations:
  - Seasonal ARIMA modelling
  - Time-Series Regression with ARMA errors
  - Dynamic Linear Models
- Model diagnostics and validation
- Forecast generation and evaluation
- Theoretical proofs and mathematical foundations

## Repository Contents
- Project report with detailed methodology and findings
- R code for data analysis and visualization
- Presentation slides
- Theoretical solutions
- Raw data and results

## Technical Stack
- R Statistical Software
- Libraries: forecast, tseries, dlm, and others
- Statistical methodologies for time series analysis

## Results
The analysis demonstrated that the Seasonal ARIMA model performed best for this dataset, showing the lowest AIC (739.4804) and BIC (750.1718) scores among the three approaches.
